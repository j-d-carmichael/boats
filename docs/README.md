An OpenAPI & AsyncAPI templating system with Nunjucks... write less YAML... do more.

## Summary

---
An AsyncAPI/OpenAPI preprocessor tool with an aim to writer "DRY'er" source yaml files through the use of a template
engine:

- Bundle multiple yml files together with [json-schema-ref-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-ref-parser)
- Validate AsyncAPI output with [asyncapi/parser-js](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js)
- Validate OpenAPI 2|3 output with [swagger-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-parser)
- Use the full power of the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating engine within y(a)ml, type less
  do more
- Nunjucks not enough? There is also [lodash](#lodash) functions baked in
- Unique operation id's based on file location automatically
- [Inject](#inject) common content and responses from a single point of control
- Mixins within y(a)ml files
- Variables within y(a)ml files
- Include files with Typescript like shorthand via absolute paths in the boatsrc file
- See [built in functions](#template-functions-built-in) below for more

Point boats at an entry index file and let it compile the rest automatically, either AsyncApi, OpenAPI or Swagger

## Getting started

Want to just see a demo up and running on your machine with no real effort... You can initialize a project via the init
command. The net result will be:

- Swagger2.0 or OpenAPI3 example files injected into your current project within a folder named src
- Build scripts for JSON and YAML added to your package.json file for CLI use.

```
npm run boats -- --init
```

Want to start with a bare bones repo then just install and add these scripts to get going:

```json
{
  "name": "awesome-api-d",
  "description": "Awesome API Documentation - written in openapi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "boats": "boats",
    "build:json": "boats -i ./src/index.yml -o ./build/awesome-api-d.json",
    "build:yaml": "boats -i ./src/index.yml -o ./build/awesome-api-d.yml",
    "build": "npm run build:json && npm run build:yaml"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "boats": "latest"
  }
}
```

## json-schema-ref-parser bundle and options

All openapi content is run through the bundle function found in https://github.com/APIDevTools/json-schema-ref-parser

The [bundle function](https://github.com/APIDevTools/json-schema-ref-parser/blob/master/lib/bundle.js) offers a few
options that can be passed in.

In boats, you are able to pass these options in via 3 methods:

- Create a .env file containing a JSON string of the options object under `jsonSchemaRefParserBundleOpts`
- Create a process.env variable `jsonSchemaRefParserBundleOpts` containing a JSON string of the options
- Add to your .boatsrc "jsonSchemaRefParserBundleOpts": { ... options }

The options passed in should be
valid [bundle function](https://github.com/APIDevTools/json-schema-ref-parser/blob/master/lib/bundle.js) options.

## Dereference the output

When building pass the `-d` or `--dereference` option and the compiled swagger document will be passed via
the [dereference](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/docs/swagger-parser.html#dereferenceapi-options-callback) method
to fully dereference document. Helpful for when working with the likes of AWS for example.

## Single or multi-file output

By default boats will out multiple files and a single combined file into the output target defined.

You can however, instruct BOATS to output only a single file by passing in "-O" or "--one-file-output".

## Validation

Errors are output to the console.

## .boatsrc

> TIP! The 2.0.0-rc1.1 release is on branch develop github - all links to the source point to master, make you sure
> switch

You can pass in options to BOATS via a `.boatsrc` file containing valid json. This is how you can control the nunjucks
engine, eg [Nunjucks customer-syntax](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#customizing-syntax). All nunjucks
options found here will be merged into the default options.

A `.boatsrc` file should be a JSON representation of this interface:

- https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/src/interfaces/BoatsRc.ts

- `nunjucksOptions` Overwrite the default nunjucks options eg the tag delimiters
- `jsonSchemaRefParserBundleOpts` Inject your
  own [jsonSchemaRefParserBundle](https://apitools.dev/json-schema-ref-parser/docs/options.html)
- `permissionConfig` Option will override how the `routePermission` [helper](#routePermission) prefixes routes (the
  default settings are shown above)
  - `methodAlias` An object of method alias overrides, please see the interface for the default options
  - `methodAliasPosition` Place the alias (default behavior) after the global prefix (if present) or at the end of the
    permission string
  - `globalPrefix` Defaults to true (prefix perms with the package.json name) else false for no prefix or a simple
    string for a custom prefix
  - `permissionStyle` The overall permission style, defaults to camelCase
  - `permissionSegmentStyle` The segment string style, defaults to camelCase (even when the main style is something
    else)
  - `generateSchemaNamed` Schema name to auto generate an enum with all available permission values (leave this empty or
    skip the option to disable this auto-generated schema)
- `picomatchOptions` An object of [picomatch#options](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#options)
- `paths` An object of key/value pairs that enable you to define [absolute paths](#absolute-paths) to be used in your
  templates. Similar to [Typescript's Paths compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths)
- `fancyPluralization` Enables better pluralization for your model names (i.e. Universities instead of Universitys)

TIP: If you use the `.yml.njk`, you will want to just use the default tags from nunjucks (which may help IDE syntax
highlighting). You can do this by removing the `nunjucksOptions` or by un-setting `nunjucksOptions.tags`:

```json
{
  "nunjucksOptions": {
    "tags": {}
  }
}
```

This will use the default template tags as show [in their docs](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html).

## CLI

BOATS can be used as a cli tool via an npm script.

### All available arguments

The available arguments are
best [read from the source](https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/src/commander.ts).

Or via cli --help

### Examples

Example package.json script, the end result would be a single compiled file and without the version number of the spec
in the filename:

```
"boats": "boats"
"build:yml": "boats -i ./src/index.yml -o ./build/api.yml --one-file-output --exclude_version"
```

If you have an existing repository with .yml files and want to convert to .yml.njk you can convert all the file
extensions, and the references with one command:

```
npm run boats -- --convert_to_njk ./src
```

To convert all back to yml:

```
npm run boats -- --convert_to_yml ./src
```

## Programmatic Use

This is tool designed for command line only, however a pull-request on github would be very much welcomed if you would
like this feature.

## Snippets

Snippets are prebuild files that can be injected into an existing file system, they can be pulled from either:

- Remote git url
- Local disk

There are a few snippets bundled with BOATS in the Snippets
branch: https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/tree/snippets

Pull requests are welcomed for more snippets :)

Example use pull from remote url:

```
npm run boats -- -I https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats.git#snippets -S oa2/crud -R ./src/paths -N beer
```

This will output:

- Fetch the snippet from the URL provided and write to a dir within the project
- The snippet renderer will then look for the optional -S flag, if present, use this subdir
- The snippets will then be copied to your project, then rendered with Nunjucks.

Example use pull from local disk:

```
npm run boats -- -I ../../mysnippets -S oa2/crud -R ./src/paths -N beer
```

This will output:

- Check the local dir of `../../mysnippets` exists
- The snippet renderer will then look for the optional -S flag, if present, use this subdir
- The snippets will then be copied to your project, then rendered with Nunjucks.

## Templating

As Nunjucks is used as the tpl engine, this means if you use a smart IDE such as intellij you are able to utilize the
syntax highlight of both yml and njk.

If you come from a PHP world you will already be used to this with Twig, Blade or even back in the day with Smarty.
These you will be used to viewing proper html syntax highlighting but at the same time good function/condition
highlighting that the tpl engine offers.

Set your IDE to use the twig syntax for *.njk files:
![Settings panel](./images/njk_syntax_highlighting.png)

Now your IDE will show both yaml and nunjucks styntax highlighting in one view without the swagger/openapi validator
complaining but we can still jump through the files with "control+mouse click", eg:
![Settings panel](./images/njk_yaml.png)

Each file is passed through the Nunjucks templating engine meaning you can write Nunjucks syntax directly into the y(a)
ml files, write loops, use variables, whatever you need.
BOATS ships with two helpful functions, `mixin` and `uniqueOpId`, but your also have the full power of the nunjucks
templating functions available to you.

If you have not used [Nunjucks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks) before, it is very similar to the Twig, Blade
and Django templating language.

TIP: The tpl helpers and the examples in this repo all use
the [default nunjucks helpers](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html).

### File ext.

You may use `.yaml` or `.yml` or the `.njk` file extension.
Adding the .njk extension allows your ide to lay on nice syntax highlighting (for jetbrains, just add *.njk to the Twig
mapping in you settings for file types).
You can switch from yml to njk via cli arguments.

There is an issue still with the `.njk` ext in that a reference to a file in another project on disk via `...yml.njk`
will break as BOATS removes `.njk` after running through the nunjucks tpl engine.

### Absolute Paths

If managing relative links causes problems, it's possible to specify a shorthand for referring to absolute paths using
the `paths` option in the `boatsrc` file.

Given a config like:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@mixins": "./src/mixins",
    "@components": "./src/components"
  }
}
```

You can reference a file under `./src/mixins` like so:

```yaml
{ { mixin("@mixins/response/pagination.yml.njk", "../generic/searchMeta.yml.njk", "./model.yml.njk", "--skip-auto-indent") } }

```

Or a schema can be referenced like:

```yaml
schema:
  $ref: @components/schemas/generic/searchMeta.yml.njk
```

### Auto Index Files

In async/swagger/openapi the channels/paths require an index file to register the routes.
By the way [json-schema-ref-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-ref-parser), unless you create an index
file then the references to component/definitions will not look pretty and easily break other tools.
Maintaining these index files is quite a monotonous chore, and very human error prone.

The index file is nothing more duplicate data; we already carefully name our folders and files to then manually go and
type it all out again in a not fun to manage index file.

The easiest way to explain this is to look at the examples and their outputs:

- Paths indexer, https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/paths/index.yml.njk resulting in the
  compiled file: https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/build/builtOA3_1.0.1.yml#L18 This indexer expects
  to find single files within an end url segment folder to contain the avilable http verbs. Also not the curly braces
  for dynamic url
  parameters: https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/paths/weather/id/%7Bid%7D/get.yml.njk
- Channel indexer, https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcASYNC2/channels/index.yml.njk is slightly
  different to the paths as a single channel file is expected to contain all subscribe and publish data in on.
- Components|definitions|parameters
  indexer https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/components/schemas/index.yml.njk will create a
  UpperCamelCase index file.

The 3 types of indexers:
Path Indexer

```
{{ autoPathIndexer() }}
```

Channel Indexer

- Options allow you to alter the separator here based on patterns, see the options below

```
{{ autoChannelIndexer() }}
```

or this, which will convert all channels with KC/** to use a . separator, outputting something like `KK.1234` instead of
`/KK/1234`:

```
{{ autoChannelIndexer({
    channelSeparators: [{
       match: '/KK/**',
       separator: '.'
    }]
}) }}
```

Definition/Component/Parameter Indexer:

```
{{ autoComponentIndexer() }}
```

If you have an older set of BOATS files then you might have named the model files without the word model, to strip model
from the naming:

```
{{ autoComponentIndexer('Model') }}
```

or you may not want to auto ucFirst the file:

```
{{ autoComponentIndexer({dontUcFirst: true}) }}
```

### Auto Summary

With the auto-summary tpl helper, the summary string is automatically calculated based on the rest path.

```yaml
summary: { { autoSummary() } }
```

Example "**user/{id}/get.yml**" would yield "**Get user based on {id}**"

A more complex example, "**house/{number}/user/{id}/get.yml**" would output "**Get user based on {id}, from house
{number}**"

You can also instruct the helper to use the filename in the output, helpful for asyncapi channel names (see the last
test in the test suit for an example):

```yaml
{ { autoSummary({ useFileName: true }) } }
```

See the unit tests for more examples, [src/__tests
__/AutoSummary.spec.ts](https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/develop/src/__tests__/AutoSummary.spec.ts)

### Auto Tag

Calculates the tag based on the location of the file in the folder structure:

```yaml
tags:
  - <$ autoTag() $>
```

The following path:
`src/paths/temperature/get.yml`
Results in:
`Temperature`

The following path:
`src/paths/temperature/europe/get.yml`
Results in:
`Temperature`

### Custom template helpers / functions

It is possible to inject your own helper functions into the Nunjucks tpl engine. For example, you may wish to inject
your own helper function that would automatically inject the package.json version number (bad example as you could use
the above builtin function, but you get the idea) into the OpenAPI index file. This is how it would be done:

Pass to the cli tool a helper function path. The path should be relative to your entry point, typically where your
`package.json` lives:

```
boats -i ./src/index.yml -o ./build/myapi.yml -f ./nunjucksHelpers/injectPackageJsonVersion.js -f ./someOtherHelper.ts
```

The `./nunjucksHelpers/injectPackageJsonVersion.js` should export a single default function:

```javascript
const packageJson = require('../package.json')
module.exports = () => {
  // assuming this is a valid package json file
  return packageJson.version
}
```

In your yaml file you can now access the custom function by file name:

```yaml
info:
  version: <$ injectPackageJsonVersion() $>
```

If the helper is a folder, boats will recursively add all js or ts files as helpers:

```
boats -i ./src/index.yml -o ./build/myapi.yml -f ./tplHelpers/
```

- Custom helpers are injected via
  the [Nunjuck's addGlobal function](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#addglobal).
- A helper function should use the `function` keyword declaration to gain access to the nunjucks context.
- The name of the helper file will be the name of the function, non-alphanumeric (and _) characters will be stripped.
- You can write your helper in either TypeScript or Javascript

### inject

The inject helper allows you to inject content to many operations from a single block.

Path maching is handled via [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#picomatch-options), you are able to
inject your own options via the `.boatsrc` file. The default options are

```
  "picomatchOptions": {
    "bash": true
  },
```

Anatomy of the injection:

```yaml
{ {
  inject([ # The inject block accepts an array of objects with options described below
  {
    toAllOperations: {
      content: { # Required - the content to inject to each, can be anything you choose. Restrictions are only valid async/openapi syntax
        security: [ { # path or channel, filtered by the options
          apiKey: [ ]            # below.
        } ]
      },
      excludeChannels: [ # Optional - string array containing channels
        '/user_messages/**'     # to exclude (parsed with https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch)
        '/system_information'
      ],
      includeOnlyChannels: [ # Optional - string array containing channels
        '/admin/**'             # only include these channels (parsed with https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch)
      ],
      excludePaths: [ # Optional - string|object array containing paths or paths and methods
        '/users',               # to exclude (parsed with https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch)
        {
          path: '/car/*',       # Exclude all car paths where the method is get
          methods: [
            'get'
          ]
        }
      ],
      includeOnlyPaths: [ # Optional - string array containing channels
        '/admin/**'             # only include these paths (parsed with https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch)
        {
          path: '/car/*',       # Include all car paths where the method is post/put/delete
          methods: [
            'post',
            'put',
            'delete'
          ]
        }
      ],
      includeMethods: [ # Optional - string array containing method
        'post',                 # whitelist (default is all methods)
        'put',
        'patch',
        'delete'
      ]
    }
  }
])
} }
```

In the example below we are injecting a header parameter to every path method:
Example: https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA2/index.yml.njk#L43

For openapi, the content will be merged/concat/injected into paths that are not excluded.

For asyncapi, the content will be merged/concat/injected
into [channels](https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcASYNC2/index.yml#L19).

Content is either a JSON representation of the YAML content to inject, or a string:

```yaml
# index.yaml
# ...

{ {
  inject([

  # add auth to all routes
  {
    toAllOperations: {
      content: {
        security: [ {
          jwtToken: [ ]
        } ]
      }
    }
  },

  # add x-write and api key to all post, put, patch, delete calls to routes
  # except for /users
  {
    toAllOperations: {
      excludePaths: [ '/users' ],
      includeMethods: [ 'post','put','patch','delete' ],
      content: {
        x-write-required: '{{ routePermission() }}',
        security: [ {
          apiKey: [ ]
        } ]
      }
    }
  },

  # add defaults to all routes
  {
    toAllOperations: {
      content:
        tags: [ "{{ autoTag() }}" ],
      summary: "{{ myCustomAutoSummary() }}",
      operationId: "{{ uniqueOpId() }}",
      description: "{{ myCustomDescription() }}",
      responses:
        '404':
          description: "Not found",
      schema:
        $ref: "./common/404.yml",
      '401':
        description: "Unauthenticated",
      schema:
        $ref: "./common/401.yml",
      '418':
        description: "Error brewing coffee"
        schema:
          $ref: "./common/418.yml"
    }
  }
])
} }
```

Type less do more.

### lodash

Nunjucks is a powerful template engine with a lot out of the box, but we wanted more so we injected lodash into the mix.

Whatever you find in their docs https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15 you can use in your boats files.

To access lodash in your templates just ensure you preface your function with the _:

```yaml
info:
  version: 1.0.1
  title: { { _.camelCase( packageJson('name') ) } }
```

(you can see the injection of lodash into nunjecks
here: [src/Template.ts#L286](https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/main/src/Template.ts#L286))

### merge

allOf equiv. for when allOf is not supported.

```
{{ merge('../userAgent/model.yml', '../userIp/model.yml') }}
```

### mixin

Example use:

```yaml
Weathers: mixin("../../mixins/pagination.yml", "#/components/schemas/GenericSearchMeta", "#/components/schemas/Weather")
```

The `mixin` gives function to OpenAPI files that previously meant a lot of repetitive typing which results in less human
error. With mixins you are able to wrap definitions/components in common content. For
example [pagination](https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/paths/v1/weather/get.yml#L9).

The mixin function assumes the 1st given argument to be the relative path to the mixin template yaml file.

All additional arguments are passed as numbers variables to the Nunjucks templating engine `var<argument index>` eg
`var1`

Mixin
file [example here](https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/mixins/response/json.pagination.yml)
and [here](https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/mixins/request/json.yml).

The mixin will automatically calculate indents. If you use a mixin for plural
models [like this](https://github.com/johndcarmichael/boats/blob/master/srcOA3/components/schemas/weather/models.yml.njk),
then an additional argument can be added to the end:

```
{{ mixin("../../../mixins/response/pagination.yml.njk", "../generic/searchMeta.yml.njk", "./model.yml.njk", "--skip-auto-indent") }}
```

In most cases the additional indentation which not break anything, but if a clean partial output file is required...

### packageJson

Example use:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: <$ packageJson('version') $>
```

Returns the value of an expected attribute to be found in your `package.json` or throws an error.

### pickProps

It takes the definitions path as the first parameter, and an array of strings or rest parameters specifying props to
pick:

```
{{ pickProps('path', 'prop1', 'prop2') }}
```

or

```
{{ pickProps('path', ['prop1', 'prop2']) }}
```

For example, a model file with many attributes might look like:

```
type: object
required:
  - name
  - coordinates
properties:
  name:
    type: string
  coordinates:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  ... etc etc
```

Another definition doesn't want this whole definition, just a part, but we don't want juggle around with complex openapi
inheritance features, so pickProps can be used instead:

```
{{ pickProps('./post.yml.njk', 'name') }}
```

The output would be:

```
LocationPut:
  type: object
  required:
    - name
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
```

### Process Environment Variables

During automated build chains it is not uncommon for api keys and dynamic URIs to be injected into the outputted OpenAPI
files, this is common with AWS's cloud formation when used with dynamic containers.

To accommodate this, all `process.env` variables are exposed in read-only format to the templates.

To enable easier development with `process.env` variables BOATS also makes use of
the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package during cli use only.

If a `.env` file is found at the root of your project then this will be parsed by dotenv and subsequently be made
available to the Nunjucks engine as a tpl variable.

> !Tip: Do not add the .env file to your git repo, this is only for development purposes, read
> the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) docs. Your CI tool should use proper env variables during a build
> chain.

### optionalProps

Allows inheritance from a referenced object definition but makes all properties optional, i.e, it drops the required
object prop.

Usage:

```yaml
{ { optionalProps() } }
```

With OA3 inheritance

```yml
allOf:
  - { { optionalProps() } }
```

Example

Given a referenced file defined as follows:

`post.yml`

```yaml
type: object
required:
  - name
  - coordinates
properties:
  name:
    type: string
  coordinates:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
```

And the helper used as follows:

`patch.yml`

```yaml
{ { optionalProps('./post.yml.njk') } }
```

Will produce

`patch.yml`

```yml
type: object
properties:
  name:
    type: string
  coordinates:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
```

### routePermission

Adds a configurable prefix to the `uniqueOpId` [helper](#uniqueOpId), allowing for method-based permissions for access
control.

`weather/post.yml` would result in `createWeatherPost`:

```yaml
tags:
  - <$ autoTag() $>
description: List all users
x-permission: <$ routePermission() $>
```

You should name the attribute something that fits your generator, `x-permission: ...` is configured to work
with [generate-it's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-it)
typescript [express server templates](https://github.com/acrontum/openapi-nodegen-typescript-server/blob/master/src/http/nodegen/routes/___op.ts.njk#L28).

You may also:

- Instruct the helper to strip out the method, turning `weather/post.yml` into `createWeather`.
- Add a custom tail string to the output
- Add a custom prefix to the start of the output

Here is a kitchen sink example:

```
{% set prefix = packageJson("name") %}
{% set tail = 'wags' %}
{{
  inject([{
    toAllOperations: {
      includeOnlyPaths: ['/admin/**'],
      content: {
        'x-permission': '{{ routePermission( {prefix: \''+ prefix +'\', removeMethod: true, tail: \''+ tail +'\'} ) }}'
      }
    }
  }])
}}
```

The method conversion defaults are:

```
get: 'read',
post: 'create',
put: 'update',
patch: 'update',
delete: 'delete',
```

Of course, you can remote control the injection of the permissions to all routes from the [inject helper](#inject).

You can control how the helper functions via the `.boatsrc` file, the options can be found
here: https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/main/src/interfaces/BoatsRc.ts

```
{
    methodAlias?: MethodAlias; // change the names used, eg instead of get => "read" change get => "fetch"
    methodAliasPosition?: MethodAliasPosition;  // Choose from https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/main/src/enums/MethodAliasPosition.ts
    globalPrefix?: string | boolean; // defaults the the package.json name
    permissionStyle?: StringStyle; // use any of https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/main/src/enums/StringStyle.ts
    permissionSegmentStyle?: StringStyle; // use any of https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/main/src/enums/StringStyle.ts
    generateSchemaNamed?: string;
}
```

### uniqueOpId

Example use:

```yaml
tags:
  - temperature
summary: Temperature data
description: Get the latest temperature
operationId: <$ uniqueOpId() $>
```

The `uniqueOpId` function reduces human error by automatically returning a unique identifier based on the files location
within the file system.
The path leading up to the entry point is always removed.

In addition, the value of the "strip_value" (see the .boatsrc section) is also removed, if a strip value is not provided
this will default to "src/paths/".

So the following path:
`/home/me/code/project/src/paths/v1/temperature/get.yml`

Results in:
`v1TemperatureGet`

Each segment of the path is run through [camelcase](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase#readme) so `this-folder`
results in `thisFolder`

This is especially helpful for API generators eg: codegen

There is however, many options to pass into the uniqueOpId() to control the output, please the unit-tests
for all
options: https://github.com/j-d-carmichael/boats/blob/23d63384e598c99fdfa459554c3bec610af43667/src/__tests__/UniqueOperationIds.spec.ts

### Variables

In addition to Nunjucks ability to set variables within template
files: https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#set

You can also pass in custom variables to your templates with the --variables option:

```
npm run boats -i ./src/index.yml -$ host=http://somedomain.com -$ email=john@boats.com
```

The variables can then be accessed via the normal nunjucks syntax eg:

```
url: <$ host $>
```

> !Tip: These variables will override any variables injected into the tpl engine from the `process.env`
